{\centering \it This masters thesis is dedicated to my late father. Without his influence and encouragement I would not be where I'm at today. Many times I would be worried about the outcome of something, and he would always respond ``it will work out'' or ``you'll figure it out.'' Thank you dad for all you did for me.}
