Special thanks to Nathan Gilliam and Dr. Jamie Coble for their help with the Simulink portion of this project. Nathan has been great to work with on this. \\
\par Special thanks to my professors at UT. I have learned much while at UT, and the UT nuclear engineering and physics departments have always encouraged me to ask questions, be inquisitive, and look for opportunities.
